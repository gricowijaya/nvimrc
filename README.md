# First Insight

This repo is neovim configuration based on the quick.nvim repo by albingroen
If you interest to learn the quick.nvim you can watch this [YouTube Demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OhbgZbORFd4)
and the repo is from here : https://github.com/albingroen/quick.nvim

What i like from the quick.nvim repo is that is using a minimal configuration
but what i think is better is using native lsp instead of using coc

## Todo 

* More Intiutive 
* Create the Documentation of the Mapping
